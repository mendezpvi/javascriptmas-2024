# Day 23 - Santa got hacked! ðŸŽ…

Santa has been hacked! In the list of kids to deliver to, the Grinch has replaced some kids' names with his own name.

The original array looked like this:
```js
['James', 'Yi', 'Florinda', 'Fatima', 'Tariq', 'Jose', 'Clare', 'Gibbs']
```

***Task*** 
+ Remove 'Grinch' from santasArr and put the missing kids back in their original places!

***Stretch goal***
- Do this without creating a new array and using no array methods other than .forEach().
