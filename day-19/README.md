# Day 19 - Holiday Gift Shopping 🛒

## Challenge

You're shopping for holiday gifts, but money is tight
so we need to consider the cheapest items first.
Use JavaScript's built-in array sort() (or toSorted()) method to
write a function that returns an array of products sorted 
by price, cheapest to most expensive. 

Log the sorted array to the console to double-check you
solved it correctly.

***Stretch goals:***

1. Log the items to the console in a more formatted way, like this (one item per line):

    ```js
    💕: $0
    🍬: $0.49
    🍫: $0.99
    🍭: $1.99
    🧁: $2.99
    // ...etc.
    ```

2. Create a UI for this by displaying the unsorted items first, then having a button that will sort the items on the page by price.
